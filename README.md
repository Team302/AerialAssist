# AerialAssist

Aerial Assist is a previous FRC robot that we have replaced the old CRIO with a Hero board and cleaned up the wiring.  


Now new C# code needs to be written to support the basic functions:
1) Drive in Arcade mode
2) Grasp (big) ball either by catching it when it is tossed to it or from the ground
3) Shoot (kick) the ball
